/**
 * Calibration for converting tracked trail pixel positions into real-world
 * lateral/vertical offsets from the line of fire.
 *
 * ASSUMED CAMERA SETUP (this matters — get it wrong and the wind estimate
 * will be wrong): the phone is mounted rigidly on the rifle, parallel to
 * the scope, pointed down the line of fire so the whole trail is visible
 * snaking away toward the target (the standard "trace cam" position used
 * for wind-reading footage). A camera positioned off to the side, looking
 * across the line of fire, is NOT compatible with this model — see the
 * README for why side-on footage can't recover crosswind this way.
 *
 * [boresightPixelX]/[boresightPixelY] come from the on-screen crosshair
 * overlay (see [CrosshairOverlayView]) that the shooter mechanically aligns
 * with the scope's own crosshair, fine-tuned with the nudge buttons on the
 * capture screen — that pixel defines the optical centreline the trail's
 * deviation is measured against.
